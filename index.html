          <strong>Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli</strong> (/ˌmækiəˈvɛli/ MAK-ee-ə-VEL-ee, US
          also /ˌmɑːk-/ MAHK-,[6][7] Italian: [nikkoˈlɔ mmakjaˈvɛlli]; 3 May
          1469 – 21 June 1527), occasionally rendered in English as Nicholas
          Machiavel (/ˈmækiəvɛl/ MAK-ee-ə-vel, US also /ˈmɑːk-/ MAHK-; see
          below), was an Italian diplomat, author, philosopher and historian who
          lived during the Renaissance. He is best known for his political
          treatise The Prince (Il Principe), written in about 1513 but not
          published until 1532.[8] He has often been called the father of modern
          political philosophy and political science.[9] For many years he
          served as a senior official in the Florentine Republic with
          responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He wrote
          comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is
          also important to historians and scholars of Italian
          correspondence.[10] He worked as secretary to the Second Chancery of
          the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out
          of power.
